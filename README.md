# DDLS-in-Python
Depolarized Dynamic Light Scattering data analysis in python. Used to find aspect ratio of non-spherical nanoparticles using oblate, prolate, and cylinder methods.

In addition, a graphical representation is shown to help with visualization.

Visit one of the following to see sample outputs created (3D interactive generated by Plotly):

## Dependencies
numpy, scipy.optimize, statistics, plotly 

## Instructions
Clone the repo, or download and unzip. Install the required dependencies with pip. Run the "Parent.py" file. If desired, add data manually to the sample_data.txt file, but this can now be done in terminal after running Parent.py.


### TODO
Add more geometries based on the geometric functions. i.e. star-shaped polymers, random coils... 

Implement into an executable interface.
