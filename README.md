# DDLS-in-Python
Depolarized Dynamic Light Scattering data analysis in python. Used to find aspect ratio of non-spherical nanoparticles using oblate, prolate, and cylinder methods.

In addition, a graphical representation is shown to help with visualization.


## Dependencies
numpy, matplotlib, scipy.optimize, statistics


TODO: Add more geometries based on the geometric functions. i.e. star-shaped polymers, random coils...
