# DDLS-in-Python
Depolarized Dynamic Light Scattering data analysis in python. Used to find aspect ratio of non-spherical nanoparticles using oblate, prolate, and cylinder methods.

In addition, a graphical representation is shown to help with visualization.


## Dependencies
numpy, matplotlib, scipy.optimize, statistics

## Instructions
Clone the repo, or download and unzip. Install the required dependencies with pip. Run the "Parent.py" file. If desired, add data manually to the sample_data.txt file, but this can now be done in terminal after running Parent.py.


TODO: Add more geometries based on the geometric functions. i.e. star-shaped polymers, random coils...
